*** This do-file is for the alternative specification where instead of using the full set of experience bin dummies, the squared and cubic of (experience - experience_bar) are included. 

** We have three samples **
* (i) CPS 1959 - 2023
* (ii) US Census 1959 - 2023
* (iii) CPS 1959 - 2023 (using only the years available in the US Census).

* Let's start from the full CPS sample **
